# Pneumonia Detection with CNN

This repository contains a deep learning model trained on chest X-ray images to accurately identify the presence of pneumonia. The model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to extract relevant features from the images and classify them as either pneumonia or normal.

## Key Features:

Convolutional Layers: Extract spatial features from chest X-ray images.
Pooling Layers: Reduce dimensionality and computational cost.
Dropout Layers: Prevent overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training.
Batch Normalization: Stabilizes training and improves convergence.
ImageDataGenerator: Augments the dataset to prevent overfitting and address class imbalance.
